# Minecraft Clone by Ilya

## Start Locally

1. After cloning (or downloading ZIP), install dependencies: `npm install`

2. Run `start` script either in VSCode *NPM SCRIPTS* panel or in console: `npm run start`

You don't need to restart the script, just press save file to reload changes.


## Some general notes

- Project has two engines:
  - **ILYA**: Powered by Ilya who's building it from scratch (stale)
  - **THREE**: Powered by Three.js which has amazing performance (ready)

- In each version camera moves forward/right parallel to the xz-plane. y is used to move up/down
